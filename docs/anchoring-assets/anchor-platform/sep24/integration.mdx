import { AttributeTable } from "@site/src/components/AttributeTable";

One of the main points of interaction with the Anchor Platform is notifying the Anchor Platform about events related to the transaction.

In general, you'll want to provide updates for the following events:

- Your business is processing the KYC information provided by the user
- Your business is ready to receive funds from the user
- Your business has received funds from the user
- Your business has sent funds to the user
- Your business has processed a refund for the user's transaction
- Your business experienced an unexpected error

This is done by making JSON-RPC calls to the Platform API's endpoint. JSON-RPC calls allows you to update the state and status of the transaction. To move transaction to specific status it's necessary to make corresponding RPC call and pass data that is required by this RPC method.

The Anchor Platform JSON-RPC API is designed to notify the platform about changes of the transaction state. Given that, it will be called every time a user or you (the anchor) take some action that progresses the transaction state in the flow.

You can find more about transaction flow and statuses in the [SEP-24 protocol document][sep-24]

## Securing Platform API

:::caution

By default, the Platform API's endpoints such as `GET /transactions` and `GET /transactions/:id` are not protected, and are accessible by anyone who has access to the server, including wallet applications.

:::

:::info

It's recommended to keep Platform server accessible only from the private network. However, you may want to add additional layer of protection via securing the API.

:::

### Using API Key

To enable API key authentication, modify your `dev.env` file:

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
PLATFORM_SERVER_AUTH_TYPE=api_key
# Will be used as API key
SECRET_PLATFORM_API_AUTH_SECRET="your API key that business server will use"
```

</CodeExample>

After it's enabled, all requests must contain a valid `X-Api-Key` header, set to the configured API key.

### Using JWT

To enable JWT authentication, modify your `dev.env` file:

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
PLATFORM_SERVER_AUTH_TYPE=jwt
SECRET_PLATFORM_API_AUTH_SECRET="your encryption key shared with your business server"
```

</CodeExample>

After it's enabled, all requests must contain a valid `Authorization` header. The JWT provided must have the `jti` and `exp` fields representing a valid transaction and token expiration time, respectively.

## Making JSON-RPC Requests

Before diving into making JSON-RPC requests, let's create a template for making a JSON-RPC request to the Anchor Platform.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# call-json-rpc.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

curl localhost:8085 \
    -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data "@$1"
```

</CodeExample>

This small script will make a JSON-RPC request to the Anchor Platform hosted on the default port (8085). JSON transaction data stored in provided file will be used as body (requests must be an array).

### JSON-RPC Request

The Request object must contain the following attributes:

<AttributeTable>

- ATTRIBUTE
  - DATA TYPE
  - DESCRIPTION
- jsonrpc
  - string
  - A String specifying the version of the JSON-RPC protocol. MUST be exactly "2.0"
- method
  - string
  - A String containing the name of the method to be invoked. List of available methods you can see in [JSON-RPC Methods][json-rpc-methods]
- params
  - object
  - A Structured value that holds the parameter values, corresponding to method call, to be used during the invocation of the method
- id
  - string
  - An identifier established by the client. The Server will reply with the same value in the Response object

</AttributeTable>

:::tip

It's possible to provide multiple updates in a single JSON-RPC call (by placing multiple JSON RPC request objects). When an update is done in such manner, all updates will be done sequentially.

Importantly, each JSON-RPC request is atomic. If one update fails, all previous updates would be applied and all subsequent updates would be processed and applied as well.

:::

### JSON-RPC Response

The Response is expressed as a single JSON Object, with the following attributes:

<AttributeTable>

- ATTRIBUTE
  - DATA TYPE
  - DESCRIPTION
- jsonrpc
  - string
  - A String specifying the version of the JSON-RPC protocol. It's set to "2.0"
- result
  - object
  - A Structured value that holds the updated transaction details
- id
  - string
  - An identifier sent by the client
- error
  - object
  - A Structured value that holds the error details
    - id
      - string
      - Unique id of the transaction for which an error occurred
    - code
      - number
      - A number that indicates the error type that occurred. Please see a list of [error codes](#error-codes) below
    - message
      - string
      - A String providing a short description of the error
    - data
      - string
      - A primitive or structured value that contains additional information about the error

</AttributeTable>

### Error Codes

<div>

| Error code | Meaning                                      |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| -32600     | The JSON sent is not a valid Request object  |
| -32601     | The method does not exist / is not available |
| -32602     | Invalid method parameter(s)                  |
| -32603     | Internal JSON-RPC error                      |

</div>

:::tip We will also be making a reference to the `$transaction_id` variable. It's an identification of transaction, that's being returned from the Anchor Platform on an interactive withdrawal or deposit start request. You can obtain the transaction ID by connecting the test wallet to your local Anchor Platform instance. :::

## Updating Deposit Transaction Via JSON-RPC

SEP-24 deposit flow diagram defines sequence/rules of transaction's status transition and a set of JSON-RPC methods that should be called to change status. You can't define the status you want to set for a specific transaction in your requests. Each JSON-RPC method defines data structures that it expects in request. If request doesn't contain a required attributes, Anchor Platform will return and error and won't change status/state of the transaction.

[![sep24 deposit flow](/assets/sep24-deposit-flow.png)](/assets/sep24-deposit-flow.png)

:::tip

Statuses in <span style={{color: "green"}}>green</span> define the shortest way. Such way contain only mandatory statuses.

Statuses in <span style={{color: "#B0BF1A"}}>yellow</span> are optional and can be skipped

Statuses in <span style={{color: "red"}}>red</span> mean transaction is in error or expired state

:::

### Ready to Receive Funds

The first step of the deposit flow after starting the deposit itself is collecting KYC. It's usually done in the web-app, but can also be optionally provided by the wallet application, using [SEP-9]. After necessary KYC is collected, a `request_offchain_funds` RPC request should be made.

<CodeExample>

```json
// request-offchain-funds.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "request_offchain_funds",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Request offchain funds",
      "amount_in": {
        "amount": 10,
        "asset": "iso4217:USD"
      },
      "amount_out": {
        "amount": 9,
        "asset": "stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
      },
      "amount_fee": {
        "amount": 1,
        "asset": "iso4217:USD"
      },
      "amount_expected": {
        "amount": 10
      }
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

- `amount_in` is the amount the user requested.
- `amount_out` is the amount the user will receive.
- `amount_fee` is the total fees collected by the application.
- `asset` is part of the `amount_x` field and is in a SEP-38 format. In this example, it's set to USD, assuming the user made a bank transfer to the system using USD.

Information abouts amounts (in/out/fee) is required if you want to move transaction from status `incomplete` to `pending_user_transfer_start`. If transaction status is changed from `pending_anchor` to `pending_user_transfer_start`, you can skip amounts

To execute this update, run

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh request-offchain-funds.json
```

:::tip

When the KYC process is long (for example, ID verification), it's advised to first set the transaction status to `pending_anchor` using `notify_interactive_flow_completed` RPC request, indicating to the user that KYC is being processed.

:::

### Processing KYC Information

:::tip

This step is optional. Most businesses don't use it: you can skip it and go to the [next step](#funds-received).

Using this status is encouraged when KYC verification may need to be performed asynchronously.

:::

Please note that you **must** specify `amount_x` fields.

<CodeExample>

```json
// kyc-in-process.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_interactive_flow_completed",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Interactive flow completed.",
      "amount_in": {
        "amount": 10,
        "asset": "iso4217:USD"
      },
      "amount_out": {
        "amount": 9,
        "asset": "stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
      },
      "amount_fee": {
        "amount": 1,
        "asset": "iso4217:USD"
      },
      "amount_expected": {
        "amount": 10
      }
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this update, simply run

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh kyc-in-process.json
```

### Funds Received

If offchain funds were received you'll want to provide an updated transaction information.

<CodeExample>

```json
// offchain-funds-received.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_offchain_funds_received",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Offchain funds received",
      "funds_received_at": "2023-07-04T12:34:56Z",
      "external_transaction_id": "7...9",
      "amount_in": {
        "amount": 10
      },
      "amount_out": {
        "amount": 9
      },
      "amount_fee": {
        "amount": 1
      },
      "amount_expected": {
        "amount": 10
      }
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

- `funds_received_at` is the date and time of receiving funds
- `external_transaction_id` is the ID of transaction on external network

Amount fields are optional. If skipped, values from previous RPC calls will be taken

To execute this update, simply run

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh offchain-funds-received.json
```

### Waiting For User Funds

In the real world, the transfer confirmation process may take time. In such cases, transactions should be set to a new status indicating that the confirmation of the transfer has been received but the funds themselves have not yet been received.

<CodeExample>

```json
// offchain-funds-sent.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_offchain_funds_sent",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Offchain funds sent",
      "funds_received_at": "2023-07-04T12:34:56Z",
      "external_transaction_id": "7...9"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this update, simply run

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh offchain-funds-sent.json
```

### Sending Onchain Funds

Next, send a transaction on the Stellar network to fulfill a user request. After transaction completion, its necessary to send `notify_onchain_funds_sent` RPC call to notify user that funds were successfully sent.

<CodeExample>

```json
// onchain-funds-sent.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_onchain_funds_sent",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Onchain funds sent",
      "stellar_transaction_id": "7...9"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

- `stellar_transaction_id` is the transaction id on Stellar network of the transfer

To execute this update, simply run

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh onchain-funds-sent.json
```

After this RPC call transaction will be transferred to `completed` status.

### Sending Payment Via Custody Service

The Anchor Platform provides a possibility to send a payment via custody services, such as Fireblocks. To make a payment via custody service it's necessary to make the following RPC call:

<CodeExample>

```json
// do-stellar-payment.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "do_stellar_payment",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Custody payment started"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this you need to run

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh do-stellar-payment.json
```

After successful processing of payment on a custody service, Anchor Platform will automatically make `notify_onchain_funds_sent` RPC call and status of the transaction will be transferred to `completed`

:::caution

A user account may not be ready to receive funds. You can check that the account has established a [trustline](/docs/glossary#trustline). Otherwise, you can set starts of the transaction to `pending_trust` status to indicate that the anchor is waiting for the user to establish the trustline.

If custody integration is enabled, the Anchor Platform will do this validation for you automatically.

:::

### Pending Trust

This status has to be set if payment requires asset trustline which wasn't configured by user. There are two ways how transaction may be moved into `pending_trust` status. First one is a processing of payment via custody service in case if it detected that trustline isn't configured. Second way is when business itself detects that trustline is missing and wants to notify user that it has to be configured. To move transaction into `pending_trust` status it's necessary to make the following RPC call:

<CodeExample>

```json
// request-trust.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "request_trust",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Asset trustine not configured"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this you need to run

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh request-trust.json
```

:::info

Payment via custody service periodically checks if trustline was configured and if it was, it will automatically send a payment to a custody service and change status of the transaction to `pending-stellar`

:::

### Trust Set

This status has to be set if business detected that trustline was or wasn't configured by user.

<CodeExample>

```json
// trust-set.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_trust_set",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Asset trustine set",
      "success": "true"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

- `success` flag which defines if trustline was or wasn't configured by user

To execute this you need to run

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh trust-set.json
```

:::info

Depending on `success` flag, status of the transaction will be changed to `pending_stellar` if trustline was set, or to `pending_anchor` otherwise

:::

### Refund Sent

There is a possibility to send funds back to the user (refund). You can refund the whole sum(full refund) or do a set of partial refunds. Also, if user sent more money than expected you can refund part back to user and send rest as onchain funds.

<CodeExample>

```json
// refund-sent.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_refund_sent",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Refund sent",
      "refund": {
        "id": "1c186184-09ee-486c-82a6-aa7a0ab1119c",
        "amount": {
          "amount": 10,
          "asset": "iso4217:USD"
        },
        "amount_fee": {
          "amount": 1,
          "asset": "iso4217:USD"
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

To execute this you need to run

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh refund-sent.json
```

</CodeExample>

:::info

If sum of refunds is less than `amount_in`, status of transaction will be set to `pending_anchor`. Only if sum of refunds is equal to `amount_in`, status of transaction will be set to `refunded`

:::

### Refund Pending

It's similar to [Refund sent](#refund-sent), but it handles a case when refund has been submitted to external network, but is not yet confirmed. Status of the transaction is set to 'pending_stellar'. This is the status when waiting on Bitcoin or other external crypto network to complete a transaction, or when waiting on a bank transfer.

### Transaction Error

If you encounter an unrecoverable error when processing the transaction, it's required to set the transaction status to `error`. The message field can be used to describe error details.

<CodeExample>

```json
// transaction-error.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_transaction_error",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Error occurred"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this you need to run

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh transaction-error.json
```

:::tip

If user has made a transfer than you should do a transaction recovery, and then you can retry processing of transaction or initiate a refund.

:::

### Expired Transaction

Your business may want to expire transactions that have been abandoned by the user after some time. It's a good practice to clean up inactive transactions in the `incomplete` status. To do so, simply change the transaction status to `expired`

<CodeExample>

```json
// transaction-expired.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_transaction_expired",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Transaction expired"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this you need to run

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh transaction-expired.json
```

:::tip

This status can't be used after the user has made a transfer

:::

### Transaction Recovery

Transaction status can be changed from `error/expired` to `pending-anchor`. After recovery, you can refund received assets or proceed processing of transaction. To recover transaction, it's necessary to make the following RPC call:

<CodeExample>

```json
// transaction-recovery.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_transaction_recovery",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Transaction recovered"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this you need to run

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh transaction-recovery.json
```

## Updating Withdrawal Transaction Via JSON-RPC

This diagram defines sequence/rules of transaction's status transition for SEP-24 withdrawal flow

[![sep24 withdrawal flow](/assets/sep24-withdrawal-flow.png)](/assets/sep24-withdrawal-flow.png)

:::tip

Colors of the diagram and their meaning is the same as for deposit flow.

Statuses in <span style={{color: "green"}}>green</span> define the shortest way. Such way contain only mandatory statuses.

Statuses in <span style={{color: "#B0BF1A"}}>yellow</span> are optional and can be skipped

Statuses in <span style={{color: "red"}}>red</span> mean transaction is in error or expired state

:::

Once the deposit flow is finished, implementing withdrawal becomes quite easy. Some parts of the flow are similar and can be reused.

The starting point for withdrawal and deposit is the same.

### Ready to Receive Funds

Similar to a deposit, the next step would be to notify the user that the anchor is ready to receive funds. However, as your service will be receiving transactions over the Stellar network, the update would look a bit different.

<CodeExample>

```json
// request-offchain-funds.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "request_offchain_funds",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Request offchain funds",
      "amount_in": {
        "amount": 10,
        "asset": "stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
      },
      "amount_out": {
        "amount": 9,
        "asset": "iso4217:USD"
      },
      "amount_fee": {
        "amount": 1,
        "asset": "stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
      },
      "amount_expected": {
        "amount": 10
      },
      "destination_account": "GD...G",
      "memo": "12345",
      "memo_type": "id"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

- `memo` Value of memo to attach to transaction
- `memo_type` Type of memo that anchor should attach to the transaction
- `destination_account` Destination account

To execute this, you need to run

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh request-offchain-funds.json
```

:::tip

Setting `memo`, `memo_type` and `destination_account` is optional.

If integration with a third-party custodian is enabled, Anchor Platform can generate `memo`, `memo_type` and `destination_address` if corresponding `deposit_info_generator_type` is chosen. You also can provide `memo` and `memo_type` to the request as shown above. Note that the memo must be unique, this is what helps to associate Stellar transactions with SEP transactions.

If your business manages the assets, the Anchor Platform can generate memos for you. When the status is changed to `pending_user_transfer_start`, the Anchor Platform sets the `memo` and `memo_type` automatically (only if it's not included in the request).

:::

:::note

The Stellar account that will be used to receive funds should be configured.

:::

### Processing KYC Information

This step is optional, and it's similar to [Processing KYC Information](#processing-kyc-information) of deposit flow.

### Funds Received

If onchain funds were received you need to provide amounts and change status of the transaction to `pending_anchor`

<CodeExample>

```json
// onchain-funds-received.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_onchain_funds_received",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Onchain funds received",
      "stellar_transaction_id": "7...9",
      "amount_in": {
        "amount": 10
      },
      "amount_out": {
        "amount": 9
      },
      "amount_fee": {
        "amount": 1
      }
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this you need to run

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh onchain-funds-received.json
```

### Amount Updated

If onchain funds were received, but by some reason amounts differ those that were specified in interactive flow, you can update amounts. Status of the transaction in this case won't be changed and will be still equal `pending_anchor`

<CodeExample>

```json
// amounts-updated.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_amounts_updated",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Amounts updated",
      "amount_out": {
        "amount": 9
      },
      "amount_fee": {
        "amount": 1
      }
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this you need to run

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh amounts-updated.json
```

:::note

Only `amount_out` and `amount_fee` can be updated using this RPC call, and you don't need to specify assets of the amounts.

:::

### Offchain Funds Sent

To complete the transaction and change its status to `completed` you need to make `notify_offchain_funds_sent` RPC call

<CodeExample>

```json
// offchain-funds-sent.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_offchain_funds_sent",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Offchain funds sent",
      "funds_sent_at": "2023-07-04T12:34:56Z",
      "external_transaction_id": "a...c"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this you need to run

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh offchain-funds-sent.json
```

### Offchain Funds Available

You can move transaction status to `pending_user_transfer_complete` if offchain funds were sent, and it's ready for the user / recipient to pick up

<CodeExample>

```json
// offchain-funds-available.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_offchain_funds_available",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Offchain funds available",
      "external_transaction_id": "a...c"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this you need to run

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh offchain-funds-available.json
```

### Offchain Funds Pending

Another option is to move transaction status to `pending_external`. This status means that payment has been submitted to external network, but is not yet confirmed

<CodeExample>

```json
// offchain-funds-pending.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "notify_offchain_funds_pending",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Offchain funds pending",
      "external_transaction_id": "a...c"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this you need to run

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh offchain-funds-pending.json
```

### Refund Sent

Refund logic works in the same as for deposit flow. For more details please see [Refund Sent](#refund-sent) of deposit flow.

### Do Stellar Refund

Integration with custody service allows you to do refund via custody service, such as Fireblocks.

<CodeExample>

```json
// do-stellar-refund.json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "do_stellar_refund",
    "params": {
      "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>",
      "message": "Do stellar refund",
      "refund": {
        "amount": {
          "amount": 9,
          "asset": "stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
        },
        "amount_fee": {
          "amount": 1,
          "asset": "stellar:USDC:GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5"
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeExample>

To execute this you need to run

```bash
./call-json-rpc.sh do-stellar-refund.json
```

:::note

The same as for deposit flow, you can do full refund or a set of partial refunds. Transaction will stay in `pending_anchor` state until sum of refunds uis less than `amount_in`. If sum of refunds is equal to `amount_in`, Anchor Platform will automatically change status of the transaction to `refunded`

:::

### Transaction Error

Works the same as for deposit flow. For more details please see [Transaction Error](#transaction-error) of deposit flow

### Expired Transaction

Works the same as for deposit flow. For more details please see [Expired Transaction](#expired-transaction) of deposit flow

### Transaction Recovery

Works the same as for deposit flow. For more details please see [Transaction Recovery](#transaction-recovery) of deposit flow

## Tracking Stellar Transactions

Using the Payment Observer allows you to delegate this step to the Anchor Platform. To enable the Payment Observer use the `--stellar-observer` flag in the command section of the [compose file](#configuration).

The Payment Observer will track all transactions sent to the distribution account. When the transaction with the correct memo is detected in the network, the status will automatically change to `pending_anchor` and event will be the emitted (if Kafka is used).

In order to update transaction statuses, the observer makes corresponding JSON-RPC requests to the platform, so let's configure the URL it should use.

<CodeExample>

```bash
# dev.env
PLATFORM_API_BASE_URL=http://platform-server:8085
```

</CodeExample>

:::caution

The Payment Observer won't validate amounts, it's your responsibility to verify that the amount sent by the user is correct.

:::

:::info

If you already have a system that monitors payments, make sure that the logic of the system matches the description below:

First, wait for the transaction to be included in the ledger (using an SDK). This transaction must have the correct memo and destination address (distribution account). Once this transaction has been detected and verified, notify the user that the funds have been received using the [notify_onchain_funds_received](#onchain-funds-received) JSON-RPC call:
